 <!--Instructions-->
    
         
            <ol>
                <h2>Instructions</h2>
                <p> Prepare & roast the vegetables:</p>
                <li>Remove the ghee from the refrigerator to bring to room temperature. Place an oven rack in the center of the oven, then preheat to 450°F. Wash and dry the fresh produce. Line two separate sheet pans with foil. Halve the potatoes lengthwise, then cut crosswise into 1/4-inch pieces. Place on one sheet pan. Drizzle with 1 tablespoon of olive oil and season with salt and pepper.</li>    
                
                <li>Toss to coat and arrange in an even layer. Cut off and discard the bottom ½ inch of the broccoli stem; cut the broccoli into large florets. Place on the other sheet pan. Drizzle with 1 tablespoon of olive oil and season with salt and pepper. Toss to coat and arrange in an even layer. Roast 22 to 24 minutes, or until lightly browned and tender when pierced with a fork. Remove from the oven. Transfer the roasted vegetables to two separate large bowls.</li>

                <p> Prepare the remaining ingredients & make the creamy relish:</p>
                <li>While the vegetables roast, thinly slice the scallions, separating the white bottoms and hollow green tops. Grate the cheese on the small side of a box grater. Roughly chop the peanuts. Roughly chop the peppers. In a bowl, combine the mayonnaise and pickle relish. </li>

                <p> Cook the steaks:</p>
                <li>While the vegetables continue to roast, pat the steaks dry with paper towels. Season on all sides with salt, pepper, and enough of the spice blend to coat (you may have extra). In a large pan (nonstick, if you have one), heat the ghee on medium-high until melted. Add the seasoned steaks. Cook, turning occasionally, 8 to 10 minutes for medium-rare, or until browned and cooked to your desired degree of doneness. Transfer to a cutting board and let rest at least 5 minutes.</li>

                <p>Dress the potatoes:</p>
                <li>While the steaks rest, to the bowl of roasted potatoes, add the sliced white bottoms of the scallions, creamy mustard sauce, and grated cheese. Toss to combine. Taste, then season with salt and pepper if desired.</li>

                <p>Finish cooking and serve your dish:</p>
                <li>To the bowl of roasted broccoli, add the chopped peanuts and peppers and a drizzle of olive oil; toss to combine. Taste, then season with salt and pepper if desired. Find the lines of muscle (or grain) on the rested steaks; slice crosswise against the grain. Serve the sliced steaks with the dressed potatoes and finished broccoli. Top the steaks with the creamy relish. Garnish with the sliced green tops of the scallions. Enjoy! </li>
