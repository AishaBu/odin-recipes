    <!--Ingredients-->
    <div class="recipe">
        <ul>
             <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <li>10 oz Chopped Chicken Breast</li>
            <li>1 15.5 Ounce Can of Black Beans</li>
            <li>1 15 Ounce Can of Crushed Tomatoes</li>
            <li> 2 Cloves of Garlic</li>
            <li>2 Scallions</li>
            <li>6 oz Carrots</li>
            <li>2 Teaspoons of Chipotle Chile Paste</li>
            <li>2 Tablespoons of Grated Cojita Cheese </li>
            <li>1/2 Cup of Plain Nonfat Greek Yogurt</li>
        </ul>


        <!--Instructions-->
            <ol>
                <h2>Instructions</h2>
                <p>Prepare the ingredients:</p>
                <li>Wash and dry the fresh produce. Peel the carrots; halve lengthwise, then thinly slice crosswise. Thinly slice the scallions, separating the white bottoms and hollow green tops. Peel and roughly chop 2 cloves of garlic.</li>

                <p>Cook the chicken:</p>
                <li>Pat the chicken dry with paper towels; season with salt and pepper. In a medium pot, heat 2 teaspoons of olive oil on medium-high until hot. Add the seasoned chicken in an even layer and cook, without stirring, 3 to 4 minutes, or until lightly browned. Continue to cook, stirring occasionally, 3 to 4 minutes, or until browned and cooked through. Leaving any browned bits (or fond) in the pot, transfer to a plate. </li>

                <p>Start the chili:</p>
                <li>In the pot of reserved fond, heat 1 teaspoon of olive oil on medium-high until hot. Add the sliced carrots and white bottoms of the scallions; season with salt and pepper. Cook, stirring frequently, 2 to 3 minutes, or until slightly softened. Add the chopped garlic and as much of the chile paste as you&#39;d like, depending on how spicy you&#39;d like the dish to be. Cook, stirring constantly, 30 seconds to 1 minute, or until thoroughly combined.</li>

                <p>Finish the chili & serve your dish:</p>
                <li>Add the tomatoes (carefully, as the liquid may splatter), beans (including the liquid), and 1 cup of water; season with salt and pepper. Increase the heat to high and cook, stirring occasionally and scraping up any fond, 17 to 19 minutes, or until the liquid is thickened and the carrots are tender when pierced with a fork. </li>
              
                <li>Add the cooked chicken and cook, stirring occasionally, 30 seconds to 1 minute, or until combined and the chicken is heated through. Turn off the heat. Taste, then season with salt and pepper if desired. Season the yogurt with salt and pepper. Serve the finished chili topped with the seasoned yogurt. Garnish with the cheese and sliced green tops of the scallions. Enjoy!</li>
