   <!--Ingredients--> 
 <div class="recipe">
    <ul>
         <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <li>3 Ounces of Baby Spinach</li>
        <li>2 Cloves of Garlic</li>
        <li>1 Bunch of Basil</li>
        <li>1 Onion</li>
        <li>1 Sweet Potato</li>
        <li>1 Cup of Farro</li>
        <li>1 Cup of Vegetable Broth</li>
        <li>1/4 Cup of Grated Parmesan Cheese</li>
        <li>1 Tablespoon of Butter</li>
    </ul>

    <!-- Instructions-->
 <ol>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <p>Prepare the ingredients:</p>
    <li>Heat a medium pot of salted water to boiling on high. Wash and dry the fresh produce. Peel and mince the garlic. Pick the basil leaves off the stems. Peel and small dice the onion and sweet potato. </li>

    <p>Blanch the basil & spinach:</p>
    <li>Once the pot of water is boiling, add the basil and spinach. Cook only for a few seconds, then drain and rinse under cold water to stop the cooking process. Squeeze out as much water as possible from of the leaves with your hands. </li>

    <p>Start the risotto:</p>
    <li>In a medium pot, heat a layer of olive oil on medium until hot. Add the onion and garlic; cook 4 to 5 minutes, or until the onion starts to soften. Add the farro, sweet potato, and a little more olive oil and cook 1 to 2 minutes longer to toast the farro, stirring occasionally. </li>

    <p>Add the liquids:</p>
    <li>Add the vegetable broth and 1 cup of water; season with salt and pepper. Cook 12 to 14 minutes, or until most of the liquid is absorbed, stirring frequently. Then add and additional 1 cup of water and season with salt and pepper. Cook for 12 to 14 minutes longer, or until the liquid is absorbed. Add 1 more cup of water and cook 5 to 8 minutes longer, or until the farro is tender and chewy, stirring. </li>

    <p>Make the pesto:</p>
    <li>While the risotto cooks, make the spinach-basil pesto. Very finely chop the blanched basil and spinach together and transfer to a small bowl. Stir in half the Parmesan cheese and 1 to 2 tablespoons of olive oil to create a smooth consistency; season with salt and pepper to taste. (If you have a blender or food processor, combine the ingredients and blend.) </li>

    <p>Finish the risotto & plate your dish:</p>
    <li>Once all the liquid is absorbed and the farro in the risotto is tender and chewy, remove it from the heat. Stir in the spinach-basil pesto and the butter until combined. Divide the risotto between 2 bowls or plates. Garnish with the remaining Parmesan cheese. Enjoy! </li>
