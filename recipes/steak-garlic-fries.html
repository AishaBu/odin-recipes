 <!--Ingredients-->
 <div class="recipe">
    <ul>
         <h2>Ingredients</h2>
         <li>1 (2 pound) Butcher's Steak (hanger steak)</li>
         <li>1 Tablespoon of Clarified Butter</li>
         <li>2/3 Cup of Chicken Broth</li>
         <li> 2 Teaspoons Balsamic Vinegar</li>
         <li>4 Cloves of Garlic</li>
         <li>Steak Cut Fries (To your liking)</li>
         <li>Salt and Freshly Ground Black Pepper to Taste</li>
        <li>2 Tablespoons Cold Butter, Cut into Cubes</li>
    </ul>

 <!--Instructions-->
    
         
            <ol>
                <h2>Instructions</h2>
                <p> Prepare & roast the cucumber:</p>
                <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a 9x13-inch baking dish with aluminum foil. Spray the foil with olive oil cooking spray.Spread pieces of butter and salt onto the cucumber and on the baking sheet. </li>    

                <li>Roast cucumber mixture in the preheated oven until cucumber spears begin to soften, about 10 minutes. Turn the cucumbers and onion slices over and return to oven; roast until cucumbers are tender, 15 to 20 more minutes.</li>

                <p> Bake the fries:</p>
                <li>Spread potatoes on the prepared baking sheet. Season to your taste.Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Flip the fries over and bake until crisp on the outside and soft on the inside, about 15 minutes more.</li>

                <p> Cook the steaks:</p>
                <li>Remove all silver skin and extra fat from the steak. Carefully cut out the connective tissue that connects the 2 halves of the steak, separating the whole into 2 long pieces. Cut lobe of meat from one half (it's a piece that is slightly separated from the larger half). Then cut each of the 2 larger halves into 2 steaks each. Sprinkle with salt and pepper.</li>

                <li>Heat skillet over high heat. Add clarified butter when pan is hot, then place the steaks in the pan. Reduce heat to medium. Cook until browned on all sides, firm, and reddish-pink on the inside. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 125 degrees F (52 degrees C), a total of about 12 minutes. (This cut of meat has a sort of triangular shape, so about 4 minutes per side.) Transfer to a warm plate and tent with foil to let steaks rest and allow temperature to rise to 130 degrees F.</li>

                <li>Pour stock into skillet set over medium heat. Add the garlic into the skillet. Stir with a wooden spoon scraping up the browned bits from the bottom. When brownings dissolve and liquid begins to reduce after 2 or 3 minutes, reduce heat to low. Add accumulated juices from the meat, balsamic vinegar, garlic and butter chunks. Cook and stir until butter melts. If liquid has reduced too much, add a splash of broth. Taste to check if sauce needs a bit of salt.</li>

                <p>Finish cooking and serve your dish:</p>
                <li>To serve, slice steaks and spoon pan sauce over them! </li>
